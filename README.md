# MiceClassification
 Classify Mice Data Based on 77 Protein Expression Levels

### ✅ Tasks ✅ 


1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset by calculating descriptive statistics, visualizing the data, and identifying any missing values or outliers. 


2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data by scaling the features, imputing missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: is needed since there are over 80 cols
    - PCA
    - t-SNE


4. **Binary Classification**: Classify mice as either control or trisomy based on their protein expression levels. 
    - Decision Trees


5. **Multiclass Classification**: Classify mice into all 8 classes based on their protein expression levels. 
    - random forests, k-nearest neighbors, or neural networks.
